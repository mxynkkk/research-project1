TOPIC: Vapour Compression Cycle Using HFC and HCFC

This project is comprehensive study of the Vapour Compression Cycle using HCFC and HFC

HFC( Hydrofluorocarbon ) and HCFC (Hydrochlorofluorocarbon) refrigerants.

OBJECTIVES:
1. Understand the thermodynamics of the vapour compression cycle.
2. Compare the performance of HFC (R134a) and HCFC (R22) refrigerants.
3. Analyze environmental impact and efficiency.
4. Evaluate alternatives and suggest improvement in system design.

   Key Features:
1. Cycle analysis
2. Exergy & Second Law Analysis
3. Comparison Plots
4. Python & EES simulations
